% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference, compsocconf]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsocconf option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
% \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{figures/}}
\usepackage{enumerate}



% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )


% correct bad hyphenation here
\hyphenation{op-tical net-works semi-conduc-tor}

\section{Introduction}





\subsection{Motivation}\label{sec:Motivation}

The motivation for our work comes from the analysis of a set of cell-tower data records (CDR) provided by the nation of Andorra. Andorra is a small (approx. $468 \mbox{ km}^2$), mountainous nation in Central Europe located between France and Spain \cite{AndorraBackground}. The economy of Andorra is primarily centered around tourism, retail, and finance, with approximately three-quarters of the nation's \$3.163B economy coming from these three sectors \cite{AndorraBackground}. With the goal of improving the responsiveness of both industry and government to tourism, the government of Andorra provided the entirety of the CDR records, which we summarize as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l || c |}
\hline
User Info. & ID (sender/receiver), Nationality (sender) \\ \hline
Call Length & start time, end time \\ \hline
Location & cell tower (sender and receiver)\\\hline
Device ID & IMEI, IMSI, and TAC Codes \footnotemark[1] \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\footnotetext[1]{These codes are universal codes assigned by manufacturers identifying their products. Of particular interest are the TAC codes which identify the type of phone the user has.}

\subsection{Limitations}

As alluded to above, a variety of research has explored the problem of path prediction from a variety of contexts. In particular, much of the literature has focused on developing path prediction for individuals using the concepts of recommender systems.  Generally, the first approach is characterized by generating some characterization of points of interest in multiple areas and then generating path predictions based on a combination of the user's history and a recommender system for similar points of interest \cite{Zheng1, Zheng2}. Alternatively, other systems utilize a context-aware approach to group users by preference limited to a specific geographic area \cite{BaoPaper, LevandoskiPaper}. 

While these methods would provide a great solution to the given problem, our data provides a certain set of limitations. In particular, our data lacks the prior knowledge assumed in \cite{Zheng1, Zheng2} and lacks a way of connecting our information to the sentiment knowledge assumed in \cite{BaoPaper, LevandoskiPaper}. Therefore, we now move to a discussion of the methods we utilized to approximate the methods above that utilize more rich data-sets. 

%%%%% NEED TO DO OUTLINE OF PAPER HERE


\section{Methods}

As described above, the set of CDR data provided is relatively limited with respect to the relevance of the information provided by the dataset. To this end, we utilized two separate methods aimed at providing path predictions from different analyses. Specifically, these models can be broken into a method for characterizing movement at the individual level (Section \ref{ALModel}) and at the national level (Section \ref{ClusteringModel}). These models, however, are limited with respect to their predictive accuracy at different scale. Therefore, we conclude by developing a hybrid model (Section \ref{HybridModel}) that combines the benefits of each individual model.

\subsection{Individual-Level Prediction}\label{ALModel}

The first model of movement developed is derived by collaboratively filtering individual paths with respect to paths previously observed in the data. First, this algorithm assumes a set of reference paths, which we will call $Reference$, with each record of the form $urec = (nationality, path)$. Then, given a new user record $urec' = (nationality, path')$ where $path'$ represents some part of the given path, we choose the $k$-Nearest Neighbors to the given path using the Levenshtein Distance (LD) as a metric of path similarity and then take the $k$ most frequent elements of these paths not in the initial path as the prediction.

\subsection{National-Level Prediction}\label{ClusteringModel}

The second model of movement developed is derived from generating a comparison of the different towers in the region based on features derived from the original data. From these features, we then clustered these regions to generate a list of the towers most similar to each other.

\subsubsection{Features}

From the features described in Section \ref{sec:Motivation}, we derived four distance metrics that compared regions based on user-dependant (connectivity, Jaccard index) and context-dependant (nationality, phone cost) features. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \textbf{Connectivity}: Given a region, we derive a vector $C_r$ that is comprised of a summation over all regional records of the cell-tower of the receiver for the 33 towers in the region. From this, we then defined the distance between two regions, $A$ and $B$, to be norm of the difference between the two normalized vectors:
$$\mbox{dist}_{C}(A,B) = || \frac{C_A}{||C_A||} - \frac{C_B}{||C_B||} ||$$
\item \textbf{Jaccard Index}: Next, for each region we derive a second pairwise distance metric as the Jaccard index of two regions based on users in the region. Specifically, for two regions, $A$ and $B$, let $U(A)$ be the set of users of $A$ and likewise for $B$. We define the distance between $A$ and $B$ to be the Jaccard index:
$$\mbox{dist}_{J}(A,B) = \frac{|U(A) \cap U(B)|}{|U(A) \cup U(B)|}$$
\item \textbf{Nationality}: Similar to the definition of connectivity, we define the nationality distance between two regions to be the norm of the difference of the normalized vectors summing the regions composition per-nationality. Specifically, if we let $N_r$ to be the sum of each individual nationality, the distance between two towers $A$ and $B$ is defined as:
$$\mbox{dist}_{N}(A,B) = || \frac{N_A}{||N_A||} - \frac{N_B}{||N_B}||$$
\item \textbf{Phone Cost}: Finally, we define the distance between the phone cost of two regions to simply be the absolute value of the difference in mean phone cost for each region. Specifically, given a function $c(i)$ which maps user $i$ to the value of user $i$'s phone, the distance between two regions $A$ and $B$ is defined as:
$$\mbox{dist}_P(A,B) = | \frac{1}{|B|}\sum\limits_{i \in A} c(i) - \frac{1}{|B|}\sum\limits_{i \in B}c(i)$$
\end{enumerate}
